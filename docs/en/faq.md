# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the DJYX License System?
The DJYX License System provides two distinct open-source licenses designed for different project needs: DPL-1.0 (permissive) and DSL-1.0 (strict).

### How do DJYX licenses differ from other open-source licenses?
DJYX licenses include specific provisions for art assets and offer both permissive and strict licensing models with clear commercial use guidelines.

### Which license should I choose for my project?
- Choose **DPL-1.0** if you want maximum adoption and flexibility
- Choose **DSL-1.0** if you want to maintain control and ensure derivatives remain open source

## DPL-1.0 Questions

### Can I use DPL-1.0 code in proprietary software?
Yes, you can use DPL-1.0 licensed code in proprietary software as long as you provide proper attribution.

### Do I need to open source my modifications?
No, DPL-1.0 does not require you to open source your modifications, but attribution is required.

### Can I use the art assets directly?
No, art assets cannot be used directly. You must modify them substantially before use, though you're encouraged to incorporate design elements.

### What attribution is required?
You must include:
- Original author name
- Original project URL
- Copyright notice
- License disclaimer

### Can I change the license of my derivative work?
Yes, DPL-1.0 allows you to relicense your derivative work under any terms.

## DSL-1.0 Questions

### How do I get access to the complete source code?
You must submit a written application to djyxstudio@163.com explaining your intended use and justification for access.

### What information should I include in my commercial use application?
Your application should include:
- Project description and purpose
- Commercial details and timeline
- Implementation methods
- Contact information
- Compliance commitments

### How long does the approval process take?
- Minimum: 30 days
- Standard: 30-60 days
- Complex cases: 60+ days

### What happens if I use DSL-1.0 code commercially without approval?
This would constitute copyright infringement and may result in legal action, damages, and permanent license termination.

### Can I switch from DSL-1.0 to another license?
No, all derivative works must remain under DSL-1.0. This is a key feature of the strict license.

### Are there any exceptions for educational use?
Yes, educational and non-commercial research use is generally permitted without formal approval.

## Art Assets Questions

### Why are art assets treated differently?
Art assets represent distinct intellectual property that requires special protection while allowing for creative inspiration and derivative works.

### Can I create artwork inspired by DJYX licensed projects?
Under DPL-1.0, you can create substantially modified derivative artwork. Under DSL-1.0, art asset use is strictly prohibited.

### What constitutes "substantial modification" of art assets?
The modification should be significant enough that the original is not directly recognizable, while potentially incorporating design elements or themes.

## Technical Questions

### Are DJYX licenses SPDX compatible?
DJYX licenses use SPDX-style identifiers (DPL-1.0, DSL-1.0) but are custom licenses that may not be in the official SPDX registry.

### Can I mix DJYX licensed code with other open-source licenses?
- DPL-1.0: Generally compatible with most licenses
- DSL-1.0: Limited compatibility due to copyleft requirements

### How do I properly mark files with DJYX licenses?
Use the provided file header templates with appropriate SPDX identifiers and license notices.

## Legal Questions

### Are DJYX licenses legally enforceable?
Yes, DJYX licenses are written to be legally enforceable contracts with standard copyright law provisions.

### What jurisdiction governs DJYX licenses?
The licenses don't specify jurisdiction, so this would typically be determined by applicable law and the parties involved.

### Can I get legal advice about DJYX license compliance?
For specific legal questions, consult with a qualified intellectual property attorney familiar with open-source licensing.
